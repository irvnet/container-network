# Content Publishing


## Objective: 
The project needs a publishing platform that provides features for content creation, but mostly to make it easy to make content available publicly with a minimum of effort.


[Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/) seems to be a great tool to handle real publishing of content that starts as simple markdown documents in git that need to be dressed up before releasing. It saves the trouble of having to set up even more infrastructure to be able to write simple tutorials (like wordpress or your pick of static site generators).

- Lots of great templates to get started
- Very easy to use the built in editor with few enough options that they aren't a distraction
- Really nice feature to allow embedded videos


### Tutorial Structure

A proposed structure for each document is:
- Introduction
- Objective
- Activities
- Prerequisites - what software needs to be installed
- Implementation - step by step instructions for the topic of discussion
- Cleanup - describe how to delete all the resources so readers don't get charged
- Demo (max 10m)
