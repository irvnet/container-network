In this segment we will re-create our nodes using the official Corda containers

## Designing the deployment

Notes:
- outline the resources a node needs for deployment (storage, ports, services, etc)
- provide a diagram of the finished deployment
- include CENM deployment
   - add as a separate optional tutorial with a link in this document
   - as a 'bonus' segment refer them to the CENM deployment tutorial then demonstrate registering against an idmgr
   - as a separate tutorial with a link in this document to register against in a separate namespace (or a separate cluster)
