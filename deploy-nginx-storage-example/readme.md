this is an example of using simple pod example with storage
this gets used as an example later when you mount /opt/corda onto storage to keep that
in an even later example individual pvcs are provisioned for each of the sub-directories for the container

this was helpful to undersatnd how azure uses storage classes for volumes and how to map a subset of the filesysstme for  node to persistent storage
